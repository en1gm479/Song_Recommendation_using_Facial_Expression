# Song_Recommendation_using_Facial_Expression
### Project Description & significance: 
* This Project was developed as a part of Robotics Club Summer Projects.
* The music recommendation model in this project is based upon real-time images captured of the user's emotions.
* This project's purpose is to suggest songs based on the mood of a person based on the picture of their face captured.
* The right music can transform a person's mood, and for some, it can reduce stress.
* Recent developments indicate a wide scope for developing an emotion-based music recommendation system. So, Our team decided to experiment with it.
